A brain death exam was done showing that the patient had dilated unreactive pupils with no evidence of a corneal or gag reflex. He also did not respond to any noxious stimuli despite being off propofol. An apnea test was performed allowing the pCO2 to rise above 60, and the patient still did not take any breath during the 10 minute interval. At this time he was declared brain death. His family requested no organ donor or autopsy be done.
