HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year-old woman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant hypertension. She was started on dialysis in . She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears to be doing well. She has a history of gastric angiectasia which she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on for a scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is the donor. She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51) and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to transplantation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End stage renal disease, secondary to malignant hypertension on dialysis. History of anemia following gastric angiectasia. She has no known history for coronary artery disease for diabetes. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS: Unknown. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married, lives with her husband. She has a history of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. Occasional alcohol. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight 160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender. She has a peritoneal dialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good femoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema. HOSPITAL COURSE: On , the patient went to the operating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed by Dr. and assisting by Dr. . Please see details of this surgery in operating room note. Also during her operating room time, the patient also had a right iliac artery thrombosis. It was noted that at the end of the completion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In the operation, there was some difficulty with arterial anastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr. came to assist Dr. . Again, please see details of that operation in the operative report. Postoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit. The patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was placed on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50. The patient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had 2 drains in place. Good femoral pulse and good dorsalis pedis pulse. These pulses were palpable. The patient was making good urine output postoperatively. Renal was consulted and made recommendations. Postoperatively, the patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout. On postoperative day number one, the patient had another ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they wanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted kidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from yesterday which was on with a small amount of pelvic ectasis. Relatively unchanged resistive indices. The patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit. Her heparin was discontinued on . The patient received 1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on , Tacrolimus was started. On , the patient had some complaint of right foot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. On , WBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on , PT was 13.5, PTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2. Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4, 100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96. Vascular surgery continued to see the patient. It was decided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be continued. The patient was restarted on heparin. The patient still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the same and not worse. She was continued on all of her immunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte, Cellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol. The patient was transitioned from heparin to Coumadin. The patient was transferred to the floor, continued to make excellent urine output. The patient had another ultrasound on because there was blood in her drain and with the decreasing hematocrit. Ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color, blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices. 7.6 by 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to the contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document interval change or resolution. On , the patient's right lower extremity was swollen. The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the right iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous thrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial femoral veins which had developed since . There is a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient continued to be anticoagulated for DVT. One drain was eventually removed, continued on with drain output of 170, afebrile, vital signs stable. She went home with services on the following medications: Valcyte 450 mg q. day, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin 5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day, Lopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg q. day. This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2 and 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime. Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium phosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours prn. The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr. , please call for an appointment. The patient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day located on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and her skin. No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the first 6 weeks after surgery. DIAGNOSES: End stage renal disease, status post renal transplant. Arterial thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography recently, but a stent was unable to be placed. A computed tomography was performed which demonstrated a head of the pancreas mass with dilated intrahepatic duct along with vascular involvement of the gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric vein. He presented for exploratory laparotomy with possible pancreatic mass resection. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ulcerative colitis. 2. Hypertension. 3. Benign prostatic hypertrophy. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy. 2. Status post transurethral resection of prostate. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Moexipril 15 mg by mouth once per day. 2. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day. 3. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day. 4. Allopurinol 300 mg by mouth once per day. 5. Multivitamin. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION: The patient is a thin, cachectic Caucasian male who was alert and oriented times three. In no apparent distress. The sclerae were anicteric. The patient was jaundiced. The oropharynx was clear with moist mucous membranes. The neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. The heart was regular in rate and rhythm. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended. There was a well-healed midline scar and ileostomy present. The extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: His hematocrit was 43.2. His INR was 1.2. Creatinine was 1.6. Aspartate aminotransferase was 51, his alanine-aminotransferase was 89, his alkaline phosphatase was 395, and his total bilirubin was 12.5. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: On the day of admission, the patient was taken to the operating room where an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The patient had evidence of unresectable pancreatic cancer with biliary obstruction seen intraoperatively. Adhesiolysis was therefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open pancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy. The estimated blood loss for the procedure was 250 cc. The patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor after being extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit in good condition. In the evening on postoperative day one, the patient was taken back to the operating room emergently for likely mesenteric bleeding. This was controlled with suture ligation, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring. The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit on pressor support and received total parenteral nutrition until postoperative day seven. At this time, the patient's mental status was extremely labile requiring Haldol for agitation. The patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time. Tube feeds were initiated on postoperative day eight. On postoperative day nine, the patient was transferred to the regular hospital floor. At this time, tube feeds were held for elevated residuals and nausea. He was still receiving total parenteral nutrition at this time. The patient's mental status was still not completely improved. A computed tomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which did not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology. The patient was started on sips on postoperative day eleven and was started on his home medications. At this time, he was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and was being screened for rehabilitation placement. However, on the evening on postoperative day twelve the patient spiked a temperature to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. A fever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood cultures. Early the next morning, the patient was found unresponsive without a pulse at approximately 2:45 a.m. At this time, a code blue was called and advanced cardiac life support protocol was initiated. However, the patient was asystolic without any respiratory effort at this time. He did receive multiple rounds of epinephrine along with attempts at ventilation. However, the patient never regained electrical activity and was pronounced deceased at 2:57 a.m. The patient's wife was notified at this time. However, a postmortem examination was declined. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: The patient expired on . , M.D. Dictated By: MEDQUIST36 D: 16:05 T: 18:33 JOB#:",

      "text": "Admission Date: Discharge Date: Date of Birth: Sex: F Service: Cardiac surgery CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest. She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test, where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was referred to for cardiac catheterization today, which revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to her transfer to , she did complain of chest pain and back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now she is not actively complaining of any pain. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have dysmenorrhea. PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY: She has diabetes mellitus, type 2, diagnosed in . She has been able to control it with diet since ; hypertension and obesity; however, she has lost 40 pounds in the last six months. SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH. MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO : Atenolol 50 mg a day, lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor, Ativan. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor. Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is comfortable appearing, in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse 72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all extremities. Her laboratories prior to admission from were white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000. Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50. , which was at (it was not at ), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative; 50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1; moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than what was actually reported on the initial catheterization results from . This was discussed between Dr. and Dr. , and was not actually considered to be 80% as previously reported. So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit, and was \"preoped\" and consented for a CABG on the next day because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o. after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the operating room. On of , Ms. went to the operating room with Dr. for bypass surgery. Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr. for the specifics of this surgery. In brief, three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross clamped for 53 of those minutes. She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips. Postoperatively, Ms. did extremely well. Her intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she was transferred to the floor. Ms. major floor issues were as follows. Ms. was followed by physical therapy, which cleared her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia while she resumed her regular diet. consultation was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup appointment. On the patient's central line was discontinued. She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain; however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this chest pain. She is, therefore, on , postoperative day six, being discharged home in good condition with home physical therapy scheduled. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. Hypertension. 3. Obesity. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Unstable angina. 6. Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic balloon pump. 7. Hypokalemia. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d. 2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. 4. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. 5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week. 6. Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week. 7. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; follow your blood sugar levels and follow up with . 8. Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed for pain. 9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation. owup appointments are with Dr. , her primary care physician, one to two weeks, Dr. , her cardiologist, in two to three weeks, Dr. from as directed, and Dr. in one month. She is also recommended to follow up in Wound Care Clinic in one to two weeks to remove her staples. , M.D. Dictated By: MEDQUIST36 D: 16:37 T: 18:16 JOB#:",

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension and depression with suicidal ideation and previous history of overdose attempt, status post likely overdose on Ambien and Zyprexa, status post intubation and hemodynamically stable. 1. Toxicology: Patient with likely Ambien overdose and Zyprexa overdose. Her symptoms of light coma, somnolence and respiratory compromise were consistent with Ambien overdose. The patient also had evidence of myosis, which was consistent with Zyprexa overdose. The patient had been gastric lavaged, charcoaled and supported in the Emergency Department. In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was supported with intravenous fluids and gradually weaned on the ventilator to the point where she was successfully extubated shortly after arriving to the Intensive Care Unit. 2. Psychiatric: Patient with major depression, recently exacerbated by the loss of her husband, now with a second overdose attempt in her lifetime. Likely Zyprexa and Ambien were the agents responsible. Multiple attempts were made in the effort to contact the patient's outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. . She was unable to be reached. Psychiatry was consulted, who felt that the patient needed inpatient evaluation and treatment. They also recommended psychotropics be avoided, and that the patient have a one-to-one sitter. Social Work and Case Management were consulted. 3. Cardiovascular: Patient was hemodynamically stable with history of hypertension. Her antihypertensives were held. Her electrocardiogram was unremarkable, although there were no studies for comparison. 4. Pulmonary: Patient intubated secondary to decreased mental status without a primary lung process. Post-extubation arterial blood gas did not suggest any obstructive lung process leading to hypercarbia or hypoxemia from other pulmonary process. The examination was unremarkable. A facile extubation was anticipated, and the patient was extubated within several hours of arriving in the Intensive Care Unit. 5. Psychosocial: Communication was maintained with the patient's daughters, who also felt that the patient should receive inpatient evaluation and treatment. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to an inpatient psychiatric bed. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily, Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Major depression 2. Ambien and Zyprexa overdose 3. Hypertension , M.D. Dictated By: MEDQUIST36 D: 02:10 T: 02:20 JOB#:",
